Important for stones:
when adding multiple shapes to a rigid body, center needs to adjust
friction is off
pendulum gains energy - (Stormer's) method of verlet integration

General:
shape penetration radii are slightly off?
small, high speed objects will pass through other objects
optimize
	every frame, set vertices to nextVertices for movement
don't allow saving when collisions present; do at end of EFH
