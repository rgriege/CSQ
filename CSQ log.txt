Version 0.1 (Release Date 7/8/12)
	- Rigid Bodies constructed of a convex polygon or a circle
	- Impulse based collisions (with friction)
	- Vector based gravity
	- Anchors and fixation
	- Optional depth
	- Organized demo system with pause and step funcitonality

Version 0.2 (Release Date 7/22/12)
	- Rings are now a fully functional collision shape
	- Rigid Bodies can be constructed from multiple convex polygons, disks, and rings
	- Improved accuracy when determining the point of collision, especially for rotating bodies
	- Supports rigid body collisions with planes
	- Added import and export functionality for demos/levels

Version 0.3 (Release Date TBD)
	- Fully functional level creator/editor

	- Supports collisions with multiple contact points
	- Velocity integrator provides more stable energy levels in a closed system
	- Resting Contact between Rigid Bodies
